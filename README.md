# [Your Chosen Project Title - e.g., Transformer-From-Scratch]

This project is my personal journey into understanding and implementing the Transformer model, as introduced in the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. My primary guide and inspiration for the implementation structure is Harvard NLP's ["The Annotated Transformer"](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/).

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of the Transformer architecture by building each component from scratch. This includes:
*   Scaled Dot-Product Attention
*   Multi-Head Attention
*   Positional Encoding
*   Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks
*   Encoder and Decoder Stacks
*   Masking Mechanisms

By implementing these parts, I aim to grasp the mechanics and interactions that make the Transformer so effective.

## Key Features Implemented (or To Be Implemented)

*   [ ] Scaled Dot-Product Attention
*   [ ] Multi-Head Attention
*   [ ] Positional Encoding (Sinusoidal)
*   [ ] Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks
*   [ ] Encoder Block
*   [ ] Decoder Block
*   [ ] Full Encoder Stack
*   [ ] Full Decoder Stack
*   [ ] Input Embedding Layer
*   [ ] Output Linear Layer & Softmax
*   [ ] Source Masking
*   [ ] Target Masking (Look-ahead mask)
*   [ ] (Optional) Label Smoothing
*   [ ] (Optional) Optimizer (e.g., Adam with custom learning rate schedule)
*   [ ] (Optional) A simple training loop on a toy dataset

## Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Core Library:** [PyTorch / TensorFlow / NumPy-only - specify what you'll use]
*   **(Optional) Other libraries:** Matplotlib (for visualizations), Jupyter (for notebooks)

│ ├── feed_forward.py
│ ├── encoder_decoder.py # EncoderBlock, DecoderBlock, Encoder, Decoder
│ ├── model.py # The full Transformer model

├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for component testing & visualization
├── data/ # (Optional) Small datasets for testing
├── requirements.txt # Project dependencies
└── README.md


## Learning Approach

I plan to follow the structure of "The Annotated Transformer," implementing and testing each component individually before integrating them into the larger model. Key steps will involve:
1.  Implementing the core attention mechanism.
2.  Building the multi-head attention wrapper.
3.  Developing the position-wise feed-forward network.
4.  Implementing positional encodings.
5.  Constructing the encoder and decoder blocks, including sublayer connections and layer normalization.
6.  Assembling the full encoder-decoder stack.
7.  (If time permits) Training on a small, illustrative task.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
2.  (If applicable) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
